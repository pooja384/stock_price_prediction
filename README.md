📈 Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting stock prices using Machine Learning techniques based on historical market data. The model analyzes past stock trends such as opening price, closing price, high, low, and trading volume to forecast future prices.
The goal is to help investors and analysts make data-driven decisions by understanding market behavior.

🎯 Objectives

1 Analyze historical stock market data

2 Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering

3 Build and train machine learning models for prediction

4 Evaluate model performance using error metrics

5 Visualize stock trends and predicted prices.

🧠 Machine Learning Approach

The project follows a complete ML pipeline:

1 Data Collection – Historical stock data obtained from CSV files / financial APIs

2 Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, normalization, and feature selection

3 Model Training – Training ML models on historical data

4 Prediction – Forecasting future stock prices

5 Evaluation – Measuring accuracy using performance metrics

6 Visualization – Plotting actual vs predicted stock prices

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

1 Libraries & Frameworks:
   NumPy
   Pandas
   Matplotlib
   Seaborn
   Scikit-learn

2 Machine Learning Models:
